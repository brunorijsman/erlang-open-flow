dl_src => dl for datalink

[Page 36] Why is the field called 'reserverd' (and not pad like everywhere else).

[Page 36] 8 bits for n_tables is not nearly enough; there are platforms which support

[Page 37] Second reference for n_buffers is ??.

[Page 37] There is a paragraph discussion the actions field. However, the struct
ofp_switch_features does not have an actions field.
